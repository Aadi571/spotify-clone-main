# 🎵 Spotify Clone (HTML & CSS Only)

Welcome to my **Spotify Clone**! This project is a front-end recreation of the Spotify web interface, built **entirely with pure HTML and CSS** — no JavaScript, no frameworks.

## 📌 About The Project

This clone is designed to practice and showcase my front-end skills, focusing on:

- **Layout structuring** using semantic HTML
- **Responsive design** using CSS Flexbox and Grid
- **Styling and theming** to match Spotify’s clean, modern look
- **UI/UX basics** by replicating an intuitive and familiar interface

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** — page structure & semantic elements  
- **CSS3** — styling, layouts, responsiveness, animations

## ✨ Features

✔️ Header and sidebar navigation  
✔️ Playlist and song sections  
✔️ Play controls and footer bar  
✔️ Fully responsive design for desktop & mobile views  
✔️ Pixel-perfect attention to detail

> ⚠️ **Note:** This project is static. It does not include any actual music streaming or dynamic functionality yet — it’s purely for design and layout practice.

## 🚀 Getting Started
